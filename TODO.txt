filter(new TarockFilter()) -> tarockCount()
move IAnnouncnig to announce package
PlayerCards.getPlaceableCards end: return Collections.EMPTY_LIST
make Phase subclasses package private
canBeAnnounced: remove AnnouncementBase's implementation
create AnnouncementInstance class (Announcement, contraLevel, announcerteam)
