bugs:

AnnouncementBridge.canBeSilent unused
GameActivity call displaymessage
TarockCount announcement: no points earned
TarockCount announcement: per team, not per player

needs fix:
ultimo button in GameTypes

renames:

little nice things:
sort announcements to user (eg. kontra first)
canBeAnnounced: remove AnnouncementBase's implementation
create AnnouncementInstance class (Announcement, contraLevel, announcerteam)

features:
handle relogin
error messages

refactorizations:
 
other:
final classes?
visibility (unnecessary public eg. getPoints(), ultimo.canbesilent)
